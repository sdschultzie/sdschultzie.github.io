    <p>Pawns are only able to move forward on a chess board. However they have a couple of special rules. On a pawns first move, when it hasn't been moved before, it has the option of moving forward 2 squares instead of the normal 1. Also pawns are the only piece in the game that capture other pieces differently from how they move. As shown in the picture pawns capture other pieces that are diagonally in front of them. They CANT capture a piece directly one square in front of them, and they CANT capture backwards, just as how they cant move backwards as well. There are two other special rules about pawns that you can learn in the <a href="https://sdschultzie.github.io/checkmateandrules.html"style="color:black">Checkmate and Other Rules</a> section.</p>
