    <h2>Opening Tips</h2>
    <p>One of the most important things do do in your opening moves is to control the middle, and develop your knights and bishops. The "center" of the board are the four middle squares: d4, e4, d5, and e5. One of the most common opening moves for white is pawn e4. As this helps white control the center of the board. Then Black usually responds with pawn e5 so Black too, can also have a part of the middle section.</p>

      <p>This is a common example of the very popular e4 e5 Opening in Chess. This position pictured here is the also the beginning of many other openings. Such as the four knights opening, and the italian opening, which is one of my favorites when playing white. There are at least a 1000 different openings in Chess all with some varitaions as well.</p>
